# Kingdom Legacy (Digital Fan Adaptation)

This project is a **non-commercial digital fan adaptation** of the board game **Kingdom Legacy**, originally designed by Jonathan Fryxelius and published by FryxGames / Intrafin.  

It provides an **interactive card game interface** built with **React, TypeScript, and drag-and-drop mechanics**, allowing players to manage cards, resources, and campaign progress online.

## Known bugs

- Some cards with optional selection are required.
- When a card is blocked, if unblocked because of EoT and the card has "stay in play", it does not stay in play.
- With the Scientist, if a Person doen't have a production, you cannot automatically produce 1 gold.
- Card id 73 Front Bottom doesn't count as 2 people for card fetches/upgrade costs.
- After an end the turn effect, you can still upgrade cards.
- The resources are not discarded when a new card is played.
